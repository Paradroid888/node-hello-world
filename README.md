# node-hello-world
A very simple Hello World app in pure Node.JS (no express). It may be useful for basic Node familiarisation or to test your environment, especially your editor. It was created in Visual Studio Code, as a means to evaluate that editor.

Use npm start to fire up the app. You can then access it on port 3000. Call the site to get "Hello World" form. Type your name into the form field and submit it to get a hello message.

This app was used as a personal learning exercise for node.js. What it does demonstrate is how 'single-purpose' Node is. Using it in isolation, it is quite difficult and awkward to build a web application. It's like the assembler of the web world :)

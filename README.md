# node-hello-world
A very simple Hello World app in pure Node.JS (no express). It may be useful for basic Node familiarisation or to test your environment, especially your editor. It was created in Visual Studio Code, as a means to evaluate that editor.

Use npm start to fire up the app. You can then access it on port 3000. Call the site to get "Hello World" or pass a [name] querystring parameter for a bit of personalisation.
